> delay_injection
- amount of time before DLL hooking is installed
- 100 (default) is okay, use 10-50 if emu problems occur (or 200-500)



> dualshock_mouse
- lets you control pad1 analog using a mouse
- auto-sets pad1 = dualshock + pad2 = mouse
  (setting controller dialog is optional)

ex. ape_escape.ini (inside shark_presets folder)




> shark_cheater
- 0 = disable built-in gameshark-style cheater
- 1 = turns on shark cheater
- 2 = hides shark window when game starts
(don't use #2 with ePSXecutor + nogui + fullscreen)




> mouse_sensitive
- controls how much ePSXe responds to mouse movement data


X-COM relies on roughly
- 50 50  (tight)
- 75 75  (loose)



(MAMEWorld Forums)
Tempest uses a ball with 72 count spinner, PC mouse uses say 300 teeth
(300 teeth * 4x speed) vs (72 teeth * 1x speed)
72 / (300 * 4) = 6% (pc -> Tempest sensitivity)





> analog deadzone (dualshock)
- sets up x-y 'center zone' for sensitive thumbsticks

ex.
(left) -5 5 -4 4
(right) -3 3 0 0

-5 to 5 (left x-axis) = centered
-4 to 4 (left y-axis) = centered
-3 to 3 (right x-axis) = centered
-0 to 0 (right y-axis) = centered






> AUtostart_controllers
- 0 = ePSXe defaults
- 1 = start special devices (Guncon, mouse)
- 2 = always start normal digital pad
- 3 = always start -all- special devices (dualshock analog)

> Max_FPS_key
- Unthrottle all speed (no limit)
- Or set F4 value above very high




> Autorun
0 = normal
1 = ask to start cdrom
2 = auto-start cdrom
3 = select iso to play
4 = ask to start last iso
5 = auto-start last iso

> Permanently disable memcards
disable_memcards = 0  (normal)
disable_memcards = 1  (off)

ex. Chronicles of the Sword - password
ex. Metal Gear Solid - Mantis boss fight





> DVD5_mode
0 = normal (psx default)
1 = shalma's disc combining kits (highly compatible)




> Fast_start
0 = normal (psx default)
1 = fast boot games




> Timer_precise
0 = normal
1 = better windows timer mode



> Opcode_Tracer
0 = none
1 = Press F11 for tracing (170 interpreter only)
2 = Start tracing at addr
3 = Freeze at addr
